/**
 * Production code reads preferences through `Preferences`, not through the raw store.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * A key reached through `Preferences` is a registered key: the registry knows it, the snapshot in
 * `prefs-schema.txt` records it, and `isExportableKey` can answer for it. A key reached through `SP`
 * or `SharedPreferences` directly is invisible to all three - and an import cannot tell a key it has
 * never heard of from rubbish an old version left behind. It leaves both alone today (see
 * `_docs/IMPORT.md`), so an invisible key is one that nothing can ever clean up.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. CareLevo kept a running patch's state - `carelevo_patch_info`, the four
 * infusion records - in raw keys until 2026-09-22. They are registered now, and this test is what
 * stops them, or anything else, drifting back.
 *
 * ## The allowlist
 *
 * Every entry needs a reason, and the reasons are of three kinds: code that IS the store, code that
 * moves the whole store rather than reading a setting, and code that runs before DI exists. A fourth
 * kind - "work to do" - is listed separately in [toDo] so it is visibly a debt and can only shrink.
 *
 * ## What it cannot see
 *
 * Source text. A helper called through an interface, or reflection, is invisible to it. `wear` is
 * excluded entirely rather than allowlisted file by file: it is a separate app with its own
 * `PreferencesImpl` and its own registration, so the rule here does not apply to it.
