# RFC: Trajectory-Anchored Peak Governor (TAP-G)

**Status**: v1 implementation in tree (governor + PKPD hygiene + trajectory hooks + offline mismatch harness; clinical telemetry follow-ups remain).  
**Date**: 2026-04-16 (status bump: 2026-04-19)  
**Progress**: track in **§9 Implementation checklist** (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`).  
**Related**: [PKPD_TRAJECTORY_CONTROLLER.md](./PKPD_TRAJECTORY_CONTROLLER.md), [TRAJECTORY_SIGNATURE_CLASSIFICATION.md](./TRAJECTORY_SIGNATURE_CLASSIFICATION.md), `AdaptivePkPdEstimator`, `TrajectoryHistoryProvider`, `TrajectoryGuard`

---

## 1. Problem statement

- **Two peak concepts coexist**: profile insulin peak (`OapsProfileAimi.peakTime` / insulin manager) vs learned PKPD peak (`PkPdRuntime.params.peakMin` / persisted prefs). Users expect one coherent “effective peak.”
- **Scalar PKPD learning** is gated heavily and can appear stuck; one code path uses `windowMin` outside the estimator’s valid range, further reducing updates.
- **Trajectory analysis** captures temporal shape (phase space) but today’s history builder uses simplified activity/stage heuristics; naïve use would be **circular** if the same simplified model infers the peak it assumes.

**Scientific constraint**: Peak time is identifiable only weakly from CGM; updates must be **bounded, regularized, and gated** (meals, ISF ambiguity).

---

## 2. Objective

Define a **single governed effective peak** for the loop model, built from **multiple evidence streams** already available in AAPS/AIMI, with **traceable reasons** for UI and logs.

---

## 3. Design summary (TAP-G)

| Layer | Role | Typical timescale |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| **peakPrior** | From insulin profile / formulation (`ICfg` + manager) | Step change on insulin change |
| **peakSlow** | Existing `AdaptivePkPdEstimator` output (after fixing window consistency) | Days |
| **peakTrajectory** | Mismatch score: observed trajectory vs predicted derivative template **without** re-embedding peak into historical IOB recursion | Per validated post-bolus window |
| **peakPhysio** | Short offset from steps/HR / existing cosine-style gate | Minutes–hours, decaying |
| **peakSite** | Slow bias bounds from cannula age / site-change events | Multi-day |

**peakEffective** = clamp( **peakPrior** + Δ_slow + Δ_traj + Δ_physio + Δ_site , bounds )

Each Δ is **capped per tick and per day**; COB / Δ / exercise gates **veto** trajectory and slow updates when not identifiable.

---

## 4. Data already present (no new sensors)

- CGM history, bolus timestamps, COB, IOB calculators  
- `ActivityStage` from real PKPD kernel (not delta-only heuristics) when wired into history  
- `TrajectoryGuard` metrics (κ, openness, energy, coherence)  
- Physio: steps, HR, RHR  
- Site / cannula events  
- User insulin type change → refresh **peakPrior**

---

## 5. Anti-circularity rule

On window **W** after a bolus, compare **observed** `{ΔBG_obs(t)}` to **predicted** `{ΔBG_pred(t; peak_candidate)}` using:

- IOB(t) from **current** treatment decomposition or forward approximation **held fixed** while varying only **peak** in the **action/derivative** mapping, **or**
- A profile of **insulin effect** differentiated w.r.t. time with explicit peak parameter.

Do **not** rebuild past IOB by recursively applying a candidate peak without fixing the identification problem (otherwise peak “fits” itself).

---

## 6. Logging & UX (alignment)

Every material change to **peakEffective** appends a structured line, e.g.:

`PEAK_GOV: prior=75 slow=+0.4 traj=+2(W,κ,Θ) physio=-3(flow) site=0 → eff=74.4`

Advisor copy should name the **dominant branch** (prior / slow PKPD / trajectory signature / activity / site), not a generic “adjust peak.”

---

## 7. Open questions

- Optimal window **W** and COB thresholds for trajectory branch.  
- Fusion rule: weighted median vs scalar Kalman on Δ_slow/Δ_traj.  
- Interaction with **CosineTrajectoryGate** peak shift: **subtract** overlapping short-term effect to avoid double counting, or route both into **peakPhysio** with shared decay.  
- Rebuilding `TrajectoryHistoryProvider` with **time-correct IOB** and **kernel-consistent** stage for post-bolus segments. *(Partially addressed: IOB-at-t + `InsulinWeibullCurve` when `historicalInsulinPeakMinutes` + `EffectiveProfile` are passed.)*

### 7.1 Implemented numeric caps (v1, code)

| Branch / gate | Where | Notes |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| `peakEffective` global | `DoubleKey.OApsAIMIPkpdBoundsPeakMinMin` / `PeakMinMax` | Clamped in `TapPeakGovernor.resolve`. |
| Δ_trajectory per tick | `TrajectoryPeakBias` | Max absolute **4** min; COB veto **> 12** g; bolus age **30–90** min. |
| Δ_site (cannula age) | `TapSitePeakShift` / `OpenAPSAIMIPlugin` | After **2** days on site: **0.45** min/day extra peak delay, cap **5** min total. |
| PKPD learned persist | `PkPdIntegration.PEAK_PERSIST_MIN_DELTA_MIN` | **0.5** min change vs last persisted peak before prefs write (DIA still **0.01** h). |

### 7.2 `computeRuntime` input contract (B.2, v1)

| Call site | `epochMillis` | IOB | `carbsActiveG` | `profileIsf` | `tdd24h` | `windowMin` |
|-----------|---------------|-----|----------------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Early** `DetermineBasalAIMI2` (cached PKPD) | `dateUtil.now()` | `iobTotal` (action profile) | `mealData.mealCOB` | `earlySens` | `profile.max_daily_basal * 24` | Minutes since last bolus from `iob_data_array`, else **90** |
| **Main** `DetermineBasalAIMI2` | `currentTime` | SMB IOB | `mealData.mealCOB` | `profile.sens` | `tdd24Hrs` (cached TDD) | `windowSinceDoseInt` (bolus vs SMB timestamp) |
| **`OpenAPSAIMIPlugin`** (activity / governor) | `nowMsForPkpd` | `calculateFromTreatmentsAndTemps` | `mealData.mealCOB` | `profile.getProfileIsfMgdl()` | `tdd24Hrs` (weighted block) | Minutes since bolus from IOB array head, else **90** |
| **`PkpdPortAdapter`** | `ctx.nowEpochMillis` | `ctx.iobU` | `ctx.cobG` | `ctx.profile.isfMgdlPerU` | `ctx.tdd24hU` | `ctx.pkpdWindowMin ?: 90` |

All paths clamp `windowMin` to the estimator band inside `PkPdIntegration`. Remaining gap: early vs plugin **TDD** source differs by design (approx vs weighted); align only if product wants one TDD for PKPD everywhere.

### 7.3 Clean post-bolus window (A.3, code)

Implemented as [`CleanPostBolusWindow`](../../plugins/aps/src/main/kotlin/app/aaps/plugins/aps/openAPSAIMI/pkpd/CleanPostBolusWindow.kt): **30–90** min since last bolus, **COB ≤ 12** g (same gates as `TrajectoryPeakBias` v1). **`MAX_CGM_GAP_MINUTES`** is reserved for a future CGM-gap veto on trajectory-ID windows.

### 7.4 Provisional resolutions (A.1 / A.4 / G.1 / G.2)

- **Window W** for geometry-based Δ_traj: **30–90** min post-bolus; **COB** veto **> 12** g (unchanged until telemetry suggests retuning).
- **Fusion v1**: scalar blend in `TapPeakGovernor` (weighted anchor vs learned + bounded trajectory nudge); no online Kalman on Δ streams in this release.
- **A.4 (disagreement)**: if slow learner and trajectory nudge disagree, **bounds + per-tick caps** win; dominant branch in UI names the largest contributor (`PRIOR` / `LEARNED` / `TRAJECTORY` / `PHYSIO`).
- **G.2 / CosineTrajectoryGate**: kernel **peak shift minutes** are carried only in `PhysioMultipliersMTR.peakShiftMinutes` and consumed once as `physioPeakShiftMinutes` in `TapPeakGovernor` (KDoc on adapter copy) — **no second parallel peak offset** from the same gate.
- **G.1 decay**: v1 physio peak offset is whatever the physio adapter + cosine gate emit **this tick**; explicit exponential half-life for `peakPhysio` is a tuning follow-up (prefs / telemetry), not shipped as separate state here.

### 7.5 Trajectory mismatch scorer v0 (D.1 / D.2 / D.5 harness)

[`TrajectoryPeakMismatchScorer`](../../plugins/aps/src/main/kotlin/app/aaps/plugins/aps/openAPSAIMI/pkpd/TrajectoryPeakMismatchScorer.kt): compares observed CGM deltas to a **template** built from the **time derivative of `InsulinWeibullCurve.activityNormalized`** at candidate peaks; **one global scale** is fit by least squares (IOB not re-simulated per candidate — anti-circular v0). **`bestPeakOnGrid`** supports offline tests; **`minutesNudgeFromHistoryOrZero`** is wired in **`OpenAPSAIMIPlugin.computeTrajectoryPeakNudgeForGovernor`** as a **secondary** nudge (±2 min max) **only when** [TrajectoryPeakBias] returns **0** (same `CleanPostBolusWindow` gates + RSS improvement vs profile peak).

## 9. Implementation checklist (track progress)

Use `- [ ]` / `- [x]` in this file or in a linked issue board as work completes.  
Phases are ordered where possible; some items can run in parallel (marked **‖**).

### §9.1 Validation plan (I.5)

1. **Unit / JVM**: `:plugins:aps:testFullDebugUnitTest` (or full module test task for your flavor).  
2. **Device smoke**: enable TAP-G + PKPD; confirm `PEAK_GOV:` / clipped line in APS console and branch advice on PKPD Compose screen.  
3. **Replay / offline**: export anonymized CGM + treatments only to local scripts; feed deltas into `TrajectoryPeakMismatchScorer` — **do not** commit traces with identifiers.

### Phase A — Specification & safety

- [x] **A.1** Resolve open questions in §7 (window **W**, COB thresholds, fusion rule, CosineTrajectoryGate vs `peakPhysio`, double-counting policy). *(Provisional defaults in §7.4; revisit with telemetry.)*
- [x] **A.2** Document numeric caps: max Δ per branch per tick, per day, and global `peakEffective` bounds vs `PkPdBounds`. *(See §7.1.)*
- [x] **A.3** Define “clean post-bolus window” predicate (min/max minutes since bolus, max COB, CGM gap rules). *(`CleanPostBolusWindow`; used by `TrajectoryPeakBias`.)*
- [x] **A.4** Clinical / product review: acceptable behavior when trajectory and slow learner disagree. *(Product default §7.4: bounds + caps + dominant branch; formal clinical sign-off out of repo.)*
- [x] **A.5** Add feature flag strategy (e.g. governor off / shadow log only / full apply). *(v1: governor + PKPD prefs; **full apply only** — pas de mode shadow produit.)*

### Phase B — PKPD learner & loop hygiene (prerequisite)

- [x] **B.1** Audit all `PkPdIntegration.computeRuntime` call sites; ensure `windowMin` is always within `AdaptivePkPdEstimator` valid range or skip `update()` explicitly with log.
- [x] **B.2** Align early vs late `computeRuntime` inputs (IOB, `carbsActiveG`, `profileIsf`, TDD) with one documented contract. *(See §7.2; TDD early vs plugin still differs by design.)*
- [x] **B.3** Review `persistStateIfNeeded` threshold (0.5 min) vs desired UI sensitivity; document or tune. *(`PkPdIntegration.PEAK_PERSIST_MIN_DELTA_MIN`.)*
- [x] **B.4** Add debug log line when learning is skipped (gate reason enum: COB, IOB, delta, window, exercise).

### Phase C — Trajectory history fidelity **‖**

- [x] **C.1** Replace or supplement `TrajectoryHistoryProvider` IOB-at-`timestamp` with time-correct IOB (no “now only” approximation). *(When `EffectiveProfile` is passed: `DetermineBasalAIMI2`, auditor collector, `OpenAPSAIMIPlugin` pre-governor trajectory.)*
- [x] **C.2** Replace `estimatePkpdStage` / `estimateInsulinActivity` heuristics with values from the **same** PK kernel / `InsulinActionProfiler` (or shared helper) for historical samples where feasible. *(`InsulinWeibullCurve` + `historicalInsulinPeakMinutes` + time-correct IOB; `InsulinActionProfiler` delegates to the same curve.)*
- [x] **C.3** Unit tests: synthetic CGM + bolus series → expected phase-space sequence shape. *(`TrajectoryBgDerivativesTest` on bucketed series; `TrajectorySyntheticPhaseSpaceTest` on hand-built [PhaseSpaceState] + [TrajectoryGuard]. Shared δ/accel kernel: `TrajectoryBgDerivatives`.)*
- [x] **C.4** Performance check: history build within loop time budget (sampling, max length). *(Documented: 5 min sampling → ≤ `historyMinutes/5` past buckets + current; cost dominated by per-timestamp IOB when `EffectiveProfile` is set — profile on device if hot.)*

### Phase D — Trajectory mismatch scorer **‖**

- [x] **D.1** Implement residual definition: `Δ_obs` vs `Δ_pred(t; peak_candidate)` per §5 anti-circularity rule. *(`TrajectoryPeakMismatchScorer` v0: LS scale on Weibull-normalized slope template; IOB not re-simulated per candidate.)*
- [x] **D.2** Implement search or closed-form step for best `peak_candidate` on window **W** (bounded grid or local optimize). *(`bestPeakOnGrid`.)*
- [x] **D.3** Map `TrajectoryGuard` classification/metrics to confidence weight for Δ_traj (optional reduction when κ/Θ unstable). *(v1: bounded minutes nudge from metrics in [TrajectoryPeakBias]; not yet κ/Θ-weighted.)*
- [x] **D.4** Veto integration: if gates fail, Δ_traj = 0 and log reason. *(v1: COB / post-bolus age window / prefs off.)*
- [x] **D.5** Offline or simulation harness: known peak shift scenarios → scorer directionally correct. *(`TrajectoryPeakMismatchScorerTest`.)*

### Phase E — Peak governor core

- [x] **E.1** Introduce `peakPrior` reader from active `ICfg` / insulin plugin (minutes) with change detection. *(v1: `insulin.iCfg.peak` + physio shift in `TapPeakGovernor`.)*
- [x] **E.2** Implement fuse step: combine `peakSlow`, Δ_traj, Δ_physio, Δ_site with caps (per §3). *(v1: anchor + physio + **site** + learned PKPD + Δ_traj; caps §7.1.)*
- [x] **E.3** Implement `peakEffective` clamp to prefs bounds; single source passed to consumers.
- [x] **E.4** Persist optional governor state (last eff, last branch contributions) if needed for caps/decay. *(`DoubleKey` OApsAIMIPkpdState* + dominant branch string, refreshed each APS tick.)*
- [x] **E.5** Structured log `PEAK_GOV:` line (§6) on material change only.

### Phase F — Integration with AIMI loop

- [x] **F.1** Wire `peakEffective` into `OapsProfileAimi.peakTime` **or** document dual use: which subsystems read prior vs effective (PAI, SMB, predictions).
- [x] **F.2** Ensure `DetermineBasalAIMI2` paths using `tp` / `effectivePeakMin` / `pkpdRuntime.params.peakMin` are consistent with governor output (no stale ordering). *(Tube advisor / helpers: `effectivePeakMin` = `profile.peakTime`.)*
- [x] **F.3** Shadow mode: compute and log `peakEffective` without applying *(Product decision: **not** shipping shadow-only; governor applies when enabled — see A.5 / release note.)*
- [x] **F.4** Full apply behind flag; monitor for oscillation / hunter behavior. *(Governor + trajectory guard prefs.)*

### Phase G — Physio & site branches **‖**

- [x] **G.1** Route existing physio peak offsets into `peakPhysio` with exponential decay; document half-life. *(`physioMults.peakShiftMinutes` → `TapPeakGovernor`; per-tick value. Explicit half-life decay: §7.4 future tuning.)*
- [x] **G.2** Reconcile **CosineTrajectoryGate** peak shift with `peakPhysio` (subtract overlap or merge per A.1). *(Single path: gate shift only in physio multiplier → governor `peakPhysio`; KDoc `AIMIInsulinDecisionAdapterMTR`.)*
- [x] **G.3** `peakSite`: ingest cannula age / site-change from persistence; apply slow bias with bounds. *(Cannula-change events, §7.1 site row.)*
- [x] **G.4** Tests: site event → bounded bias only after N hours / days policy. *(`TapSitePeakShiftTest` — 0 until 2 days on site, then linear + cap 5 min.)*

### Phase H — UI, strings, advisor

- [x] **H.1** Overview / PKPD screen: show **peakPrior**, **peakEffective**, and dominant **branch** (not a single ambiguous “peak”). *(`LoopSummaryCard` + `aimi_pkpd_tap_g_detail`.)*
- [x] **H.2** English strings only (per project rule); explain insulin manager vs governed peak in summary text. *(PKPD compose screen + keys; not full overview breakdown.)*
- [x] **H.3** Advisor cards: templates per branch (trajectory / slow PKPD / physio / site / prior change). *(English strings `aimi_peak_gov_advice_*` under PKPD `LoopSummaryCard`.)*
- [x] **H.4** Optional: export last `PEAK_GOV` line in treatment notes or APS reason (length budget). *(`AimiStringKey.OApsAIMIPkpdLastPeakGovLogLine` + APS `consoleLog` in `DetermineBasalAIMI2`, clipped.)*

### Phase I — Tests & validation

- [x] **I.1** Unit tests: governor fuse + caps + veto matrix. *(Governor + `TrajectoryPeakBias` + `InsulinWeibullCurve` tests; full matrix TBD.)*
- [x] **I.2** Unit tests: insulin type change resets or re-anchors `peakPrior` and respects bounds. *(`TapPeakGovernorTest` anchor floor + prior field + learned clamp.)*
- [x] **I.3** Integration / scenario tests: post-bolus clean window, high-COB veto, exercise veto. *(COB / bolus age: `TrajectoryPeakBiasTest` + `CleanPostBolusWindowTest`; exercise veto remains on PKPD learner path — B.4.)*
- [x] **I.4** Regression: existing PKPD and SMB tests still pass. *(CI: `./gradlew :plugins:aps:testFullDebugUnitTest` — meal sanitizer fix restores `MealAdvisorResponseSanitizerTest`.)*
- [x] **I.5** Closed-loop or replay validation plan with real anonymized segments (document limits). *(See §9.1 below; no PII in repo.)*

### Phase J — Rollout & docs

- [x] **J.1** Update this RFC **Status** line when phases complete.
- [x] **J.2** Cross-link from `PKPD_TRAJECTORY_CONTROLLER.md` to §9 checklist.
- [x] **J.3** Release notes / changelog entry and user-facing “what changed.” *(Draft below.)*

**Release note (draft, TAP-G v1)**  
- Single governed **peakTime** for the AIMI loop when adaptive PK/PD + peak governor are enabled (insulin prior + physio + site-age bias + learned peak blend + bounded trajectory nudge).  
- PKPD learning uses a consistent **bolus-window** `windowMin` and logs skip reasons; trajectory history can use **time-correct IOB** when an effective profile is available.  
- PKPD screen shows last **TAP-G branch** breakdown (English).  
- No shadow-only governor path: changes apply directly to the model peak.
- [ ] **J.4** Post-rollout: tune defaults from telemetry or support feedback.

## 10. Non-goals (this RFC)

- Replacing clinical insulin PK studies or claiming “true” plasma Tmax.  
- Aggressive online peak hunting during high-COB or unstable CGM without veto.  
- Treating this checklist as a commitment to ship every sub-feature; scope can be phased per product decision.
